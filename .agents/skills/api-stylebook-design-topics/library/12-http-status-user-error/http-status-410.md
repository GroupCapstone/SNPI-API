## 1. Original Topic Definition

> "Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a *404 Not Found* may be used instead.

## 2. In-Depth Architectural Knowledge Learned

Defines standard semantics, headers, and payload expectations for HTTP status code 410.

### Core Design Rules & Invariants:
* **Consistency**: Every API endpoint handling `http-status-410` must adhere to identical semantic contracts.
* **Client Decoupling**: Contracts must decouple client expectations from internal schema migrations.
* **Security & Isolation**: Multi-tenant scoping and authorization checks must guard `http-status-410` operations.

### Concrete HTTP Syntax / Representation:
```http
HTTP/1.1 410
```

## 4. Human & Agent Quick Reference Matrix

| Design Aspect | Standard Recommended Pattern | Anti-Pattern to Avoid |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architectural Execution** | Return status code 410 strictly when conditions specified by RFC 9110 and guidelines are met. | Misusing 410 for unrelated semantic conditions or masking errors with 200 OK. |
| **Contract Stability** | Version and document `http-status-410` formally in `@snp/shared` | Breaking `http-status-410` behavior without migration paths |
| **Error Feedback** | Return standard RFC 7807 problem details | Silent failures or generic 500 error envelopes |

## 5. Standby Project Checklist (Apply When Commanded)

When explicitly instructed to apply this knowledge to the monorepo, verify:
- [ ] Review `apps/backend/src/modules/` endpoints touching `http-status-410`.
- [ ] Verify `@snp/shared` DTOs and Zod validation schemas conform to `410 Gone` standard.
- [ ] Ensure tenant scoping (`schoolId`, `branchId`) is strictly enforced.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:api` and `npm run typecheck` to verify contract integrity.
