## 1. Original Topic Definition

> "The 300 (Multiple Choices) status code indicates that the target resource has more than one representation, each with its own more specific identifier, and information about the alternatives is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred representation by redirecting its request to one or more of those identifiers. In other words, the server desires that the user agent engage in reactive negotiation to select the most appropriate representation(s) for its needs.

## 2. Architectural Principles Learned

This design topic governs **300 Multiple Choices** within the domain of **HTTP Status Redirection**.

### Key Considerations for Modern REST APIs:
* **Consistency & Predictability**: APIs must treat `http-status-300` predictably across all endpoints, minimizing consumer surprise.
* **Client Decoupling**: Contracts regarding `http-status-300` must decouple client implementation details from internal service models.
* **Scalability & Performance**: Proper design of `http-status-300` prevents unneeded compute overhead, database contention, and network payloads.

## 4. Human & Agent Quick Reference Matrix

| Design Aspect | Standard Recommended Pattern | Anti-Pattern to Avoid |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Syntax / Representation** | Follow industry consensus documented above | Inventing non-standard proprietary solutions |
| **Contract Stability** | Version and document `http-status-300` formally | Changing `http-status-300` behavior without migration paths |
| **Error Feedback** | Return standard RFC 7807 problem details | Silent failures or generic 500 error envelopes |

## 5. Standby Project Checklist (Apply When Commanded)

When explicitly instructed to apply this knowledge to the monorepo, verify:
- [ ] Review `apps/backend/src/modules/` endpoints touching `http-status-300`.
- [ ] Verify `@snp/shared` DTOs and Zod validation schemas conform to `300 Multiple Choices` standard.
- [ ] Ensure tenant scoping (`schoolId`, `branchId`) is strictly enforced.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:api` and `npm run typecheck` to verify contract integrity.
